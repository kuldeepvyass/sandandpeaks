                                 Spiti Valley refers to “midde land”, which falls in place since it literally lies between Tibet and India. This valley located within Himachal Pradesh is one of the remotest and least populated areas in India. Owing to this fact, the place beholds the natural marvels and beauty of the cold barren desert, marred by lush green patches in certain regions. These scenic and charming visions have the capability of leaving individuals wonderstruck.
                            </br></br>
                                 Despite its overall muddy and arid landscape, Spiti is a safe haven whose residents follow traditions and cultural festivities as per the Ladakhi and Tibetan influence. And, it’s due to this religious and cultural heritage that Spiti Valley acts as a gateway for one’s spiritual awakening, away from the polluted and heavily congested surroundings of metropolitan cities.
                            </br></br>
                                 This place is also the last standing ground that provides a secure home to the Buchen Lamas of the Nyingmapa sect of Buddhism.    
                            </br></br>
                                 Herman Melville said, “It is not down in any map; true places never are”. Similarly, you will encounter many such undiscovered locations in Spiti that no one’s ever heard of before. It’s the land of the unknown, and as you embark on the journey to explore such hidden mysteries, you may end up finding yourself too.
                           </br></br>
                                 There’s a lot in store waiting for you at Spiti Valley. In order to come up with a meticulous itinerary for your trip, we’ve detailed everything you need to know before packing your bags.
                            </p>


                            <h2>How to Reach</h2>
                            <div class="two-colums">
                                <div>
                                    <p>
                                        Due to the cold desert’s remote location, arriving at the final destination can be quite challenging.    
                                        And regardless of which mode of transport you opt for, traveling via road is inevitable in the end. A detailed route for traveling via train, flight, or road to Spiti valley is listed out below.
                                        
                                    </p>
                                </div>
                                
                            </div>
                           <h3>By Train</h3>
                            <p>
                               There are around three ways to reach Spiti Valley when traveling via train. The nearest metro station to Spiti Valley is Joginder Nagar Railway Station, located at a distance of 360 km. If taking Manali as the point of reference then the station is 160 km away from there. 
                           </br>
                                Another feasible route is via Shimla since Jogindernagar isn’t as well connected as other railway stations. The Shimla Railway Station is another alternative (the distance between Shimla and Spiti Valley is about 416 km). To reach here you’ll have to first board the train destined to Kalka from either Chandigarh or Delhi. Then board another train from Kalka to Shimla, and from Shimla get on board a bus or cab to finally reach Spiti Valley.
                            </br>
                            Nevertheless, the best way out of all these routes is from Chandigarh since it’s the least complicated one. First, you’ll have to board a train to Chandigarh and then by either a bus or taxi reach Spiti Valley.
                            </p>
                            
                            <h6>By Flight</h6>
                            <p>
                                Air journey to Spiti Valley is again a bit complex and arduous as the nearest airport to Spiti Valley is 260 km away in Kullu. The Kullu airport is also merely a domestic airport so direct flights may not always be possible.  Upon reaching Kullu, one needs to travel for about 8 hours to reach Spiti Valley. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                 Otherwise, Chandigarh has the nearest international airport, which is again quite far from Spiti Valley. 
                            </p>
                            
                            <h6>By Road</h6>
                            <p>
                               No matter which means of transport you choose, you will ultimately have to travel via road to reach your final destination. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Traveling from various cities like Delhi, Chandigarh, Manali, Shimla, etc to Spiti Valley is possible almost year-round (however, it’s dangerous due to landslides and slippery roads during Winters). One can either take the Manali route going through Rohtang Pass; the Shimla route or the Srinagar route, passing through Kargil.
                            </p>
                            
                            <h3>Network Connectivity Status</h3>
                            <p>
                                The high-altitude location of Spiti Valley is the reason for the regular disruption in network connectivity here. In 2021, residents of the area even complained regarding this matter to higher authorities. <br/>
                                Lack of internet connectivity has had a disheartening impact during the pandemic, especially on the students as their education is on the line.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Many secluded villages like Lari village have witnessed this case of failing internet connectivity. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                               Mobile towers of BSNL and Jio have been stationed in Tabo. Therefore, one has to travel there to catch a signal and better connectivity.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                               Although both pre-paid and post-paid connections function here, out of all the network providers, BSNL or MTNL services offer better coverage. Airtel and Jio’s connectivity is mostly limited from Kinnaur Valley to Spillow.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                               BSNL and Airtel networks are accessible in Reckong Peo, Sangla, Chitkul, and Kalpa. However, routes like Chandratal to Losar or Gramphu to Batal have no connectivity at all.

                            <h6>Top 5 Dishes You Must Taste</h6>
                            <h6>Dhaam</h6>
                            <p>
                                This is basically what we refer to as a full-fledged thali in North India. Initially, it was a meal reserved for the Himachali Brahmins and would be served to them on leaves. Every special occasion or festival is put together by preparing this meal, for which “botis” (chefs who cater to this specific dish) are hired. A nutritious plate of Dhaam is accompanied with the base formed by rice and topped with “masala sabzis” like rajma, kadi, madra, boor ki Badi.
                            </p>
                            <h6>Thukpa</h6>
                            <p>
                               A lot of delicacies specific to Spiti Valley have been influenced by the Tibetan culture and its cuisine. Thukpa is one such item on the food menu of Himachal Pradesh, and it’s widely consumed by the localites. The combination of noodles, some basic cooked vegetables, chicken or beef soup with chutney is filled with enough warmth to charge you up for the Winters.
                            </p>
                            <h6>Madra</h6>
                            <p>
                                One serving of madra is a seasoned amalgamation of chickpeas, some vegetables, and spices, with dahi as its foundation, thereby making it similar to kadi. It’s often eaten along with puris and can be served throughout all three meals of the day.
                            </p>
                            <h6>Siddu</h6>
                            <p>
                                Siddu is the “pahari” local bread made of wheat. Its preparation requires a lot of patience and time. The efforts are worth it in the end as the bread stuffed with numerous fillings is regularly consumed with dal or mutton, and this combination works wonders. 
                            </p>
                            <h6>Aktori</h6>
                            <p>
                               This old recipe may now be famous all over Himachal Pradesh but it was born in Lahaul- Spiti. Aktori is quite popular during the festive season. For its preparation, buckwheat leaves are mixed in wheat flour, then the prepared batter is cooked on the pan like a pancake. And so, the Pahari pancake lookalike is often served with honey for better taste.

                            <p>
                                Interaction with the locals of any region is inevitable. Residents of Spiti Valley speak Hindi, Sanskrit and Bodh. The traditions followed by the people are similar to the ones defined in Tibetan and Ladakhi cultures.
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>
                               As far as religion is concerned, the people follow either the Hindu tenets or are believers of Tibetan Buddhism of the Drukpa order or Gelgpa order. Earlier people also used to the religion called Lung Pe Chhoi, influenced by the Bon religion of Tibet.
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>
                                Now on to the major festivals celebrated here. Losar festival (or Halda) is celebrated sometime between January and February annually. This date is finalized by the Lamas.
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>
                                The locals share a deep connection with their religion, which ultimately ties them to their roots and homeland as well. One can correlate this natural bond to a kind of reverence of the land. This is why the moonscape of Spiti has been able to preserve its heavenly charm and beauty and save itself from the destructive clutches of modernization.

                                Depending on what kind of activities one wants to indulge in and the aura one wants to witness, the itinerary can vary accordingly. While it’s not recommended to travel during the short interval of monsoon season since roads are often blocked due to the damages caused by rainfall, summer and winter both offer a unique window of panoramic views respectively.
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>
                               The long winter of Spiti Valley is engulfed in a dark and gloomy situation due to the lack of the sun’s warmth and the ubiquitous snow-covered surfaces. Tourists often avoid this time of the year due to its extremely ruthless cold conditions. Nevertheless, it appears to be a wonderland decked with snow in every direction, and some people wish to bear witness to this picturesque vision.
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>
                                Summertime is when Spiti is most visited by wanderlusts because the snow starts to subside and sightseeing is made possible. The average temperature throughout the day is also pleasant enough for people to take pleasure in the activities they wish to perform. The colorful landscape is visible and various festivities are also organized in the valley at this time. Therefore, the time frame between April - July is the most suitable for coming up with your itinerary for a trip to Spiti Valley.

                               For foreign nationals, bringing their passports is extremely essential, and foreigners need a Protected Area Permit to enter the valley.

                                Inner Line Permit is also required if you’re planning to visit Kaza and Reckong Peo. <br> Moving on to the clothing. Regardless of which month you travel to this destination, you need to carry fleece jackets and extra thermals. The weather conditions are very unpredictable, even during the Summer season, one can never know when cold winds start brewing. <br> Even though rain isn’t as common, you should have a raincoat with you. <br> Insulated boots are a must during Winter, else you may be exposed to frostbite.

                                Carrying your electronic gadgets like power banks, chargers, cameras, earphones, etc is another common habit, so make a list of everything that will be accompanying you.
